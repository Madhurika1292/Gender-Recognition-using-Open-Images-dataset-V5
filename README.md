# Gender-Recognition-using-Open-Images-dataset-V5
Here, we are proposing of this dataset to evaluate a model using deep learning techniques to detect human faces in images and then predict the image-based gender. To that end, the special pre -trained algorithm from source - https://github.com/arunponnusamy/gender-detection-keras will be trained on a dataset of men and women (Human Face) photos. The algorithm would predict a person's gender after training just by examining his / her face.
